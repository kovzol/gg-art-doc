# GeoGebra Automated Reasoning Tools – A Tutorial

This repository contains the LaTeX sources for creating the official tutorial for GeoGebra Automated Reasoning Tools.

## PDF version

The latest official PDF version of the tutorial takes place in the [pdf](pdf) folder. Currently there is only an English version.
Please feel free to make a copy of [english.tex](english.tex) and contribute a translation.

## Compilation

We use the command `pdflatex english` twice to generate the PDF version. Alternatively the `make` command does
the same.

## GeoGebra files

The figures have been created directly by using the desktop version of GeoGebra. These sources take place in the [ggb](ggb) folder.

## Planned changes on the Tutorial
* Add references
* Explain the difference between using axes and switching them off
